# G4.Abstraction Solution

A collection of libraries for streamlined command-line processing, structured logging, and WebDriver initialization in .NET projects. The **G4.Abstraction** solution consists of three main components:

1. **[G4.Abstraction.Cli](./docs/packages-readme/G4.Abstraction.Cli.md)**
2. **[G4.Abstraction.Logging](./docs/packages-readme/G4.Abstraction.Logging.md)**
3. **[G4.Abstraction.WebDriver](./docs/packages-readme/G4.Abstraction.WebDriver.md)**

Each library is designed to work independently or together, providing flexibility for developers who need:

- **Robust command-line argument parsing** and validation  
- **Configurable, structured logging** with multiple output formats  
- **WebDriver setup** (local or remote) with minimal boilerplate  

## Quick Start

1. Choose the library or libraries you need:
   - **CLI parsing** with [G4.Abstraction.Cli](./docs/packages-readme/G4.Abstraction.Cli.md)  
   - **Structured logging** with [G4.Abstraction.Logging](./docs/packages-readme/G4.Abstraction.Logging.md)  
   - **WebDriver abstraction** with [G4.Abstraction.WebDriver](./docs/packages-readme/G4.Abstraction.WebDriver.md)  

2. Install the corresponding NuGet package(s):
   ```bash
   dotnet add package G4.Abstraction.Cli
   dotnet add package G4.Abstraction.Logging
   dotnet add package G4.Abstraction.WebDriver
   ```

3. Configure and use the libraries as described in each project's documentation (linked above).
